# portfolio-sweep
Portfolio Sweep - generate unified reports on a set of differently structured projects in Jira

# Goal
Create unified reports on work planned and done out of Jira for a whole portfolio.
Instead of creating "dashboards" per project or team, and instead of requiring domain-knowledge dependent interaction with the Jira interface to create reports, all relevant reports are created automatically and brought together in an easy to browse format.

# Assumptions
1. An extra Jira project can be created for project meta-data
2. No assumptions on methodology (Scrum or Kanban, storypoints or estimations in time)

# Plan
More details on features and the order of development can be found in the [plan](plan.md)

# Installation
Details on installs are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
